# Excel-Project_EDA---Titanic-Survivors
🚢 Titanic EDA with Excel (Parts 1–7)

This project walks through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset (train.csv from Kaggle) entirely in Excel. It replicates the steps shown in the video series, building up from descriptive statistics to advanced visualizations.

📂 Project Workflow

Setup

Download Titanic train.csv from Kaggle.

Open in Excel, save as EDA_Titanic.xlsx.

Convert to Table (Insert → Table) for reproducibility.

Enable Analysis ToolPak (Excel Add-ins).

📊 EDA Steps

Part 1 — Basic Numerics

Descriptive Statistics (Age, Fare).

Mean, Median, Std Dev, Skewness, etc.

Part 2 — Categoricals

Counts via COUNTIF/COUNTIFS.

PivotTables for Survived × Sex, Survived × Pclass.

Proportions (% of row totals).

Part 3 — Histograms

Age & Fare distributions.

Detect skew, missing values, and outliers.

Part 4 — Box Plots

Five-number summary.

Compare Age/Fare distributions between survivors and non-survivors.

Part 5 — Bar Charts

Survival counts & percentages by Pclass and Sex.

Highlight differences between raw counts vs proportions.

Part 6 — Scatter Plots

Age vs Fare relationship.

Add trendline, R², and interpret correlation.

Part 7 — Treemap

Hierarchical visualization of Pclass → Sex.

Area corresponds to passenger counts.

🔑 Key Insights

~38% overall survival rate.

Females had ~70% survival vs ~20–30% for males.

First class survival rates much higher than third class.

Fare is heavily right-skewed (outliers).

Age distribution shows most passengers were adults; children sometimes had better survival odds.

Missing values (Age, Cabin) need special handling.

📌 Deliverables

Workbook structure (recommended):

Data — raw Titanic dataset (as Table).

Descriptives — numeric stats for Age/Fare.

Categorical_Summaries — pivots & counts.

Histograms — Age & Fare charts.

Boxplots — Age & Fare (with group comparisons).

Charts — bar, scatter, treemap.

Insights — final bullet summary.
